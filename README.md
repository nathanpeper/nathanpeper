### Hello World <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

<p>Welcome to my gihub! My name is Nathan Peper and I love collaborating to pathfind, create, and build things that connect the physical and digital worlds for positive impact.</p> 

<p>I'm currently the Head of Strategy and Business Innovation for the <a href="https://www.intel.com/health" target="_blank" style="color: #2C6BAC; font-weight: bold">Healthcare</a> team at Intel.</p>

<p>I love open-source and collaboration, but more importantly, I believe in failing fast and sharing lessons learned. My intentions for my GitHub and my other sites are that I can share lessons from my triumphs and my failures on the journey to becoming the next Iron Man...</p>

<p>I am a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I earned both a <a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/" target="_blank" style="color: #2C6BAC; font-weight: bold">Master of Science in Aeronautics and Astronautics</a>, with a focus on complex system design, and a <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/" target="_blank" style="color: #2C6BAC; font-weight: bold">Master of Business Administration</a>. With the increasing importance and potential for scalable impact of data, analytics, and AI, I also earned a Master of Information and Data Science from the <a href="https://datascience.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" style="color: #2C6BAC; font-weight: bold">University of California, Berkeley</a>. I am also a graduate of the <a href="https://www.westpoint.edu/" target="_blank" style="color: #2C6BAC; font-weight: bold">United States Military Academy</a>, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering with additional focus on Aeronautical Engineering.</p>
